TODO

* Add emonhub user to dialout group.

* What's the exact license this is issued under?  emonhub.py says AGPL, but
  which version, and are all files covered by this statement?

* Who is the copyright owner for files in this repository?  (Needed for
  debian/copyright.)

* Write manpage for emonhub.

* Make config file reloading work more sensibly so the editor in emoncms works
  again.
